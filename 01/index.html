                        Dear Prof. Price,

                        I was told to enrol in this class by someone, I don't know who. It seems like kind of a bad idea but I'm going to do it anyway because I don't have any ideas of my own and anyway I always do what I'm told. I have a couple of questions though, can you please answer them? <br>
                        <br>
                        Assignments<br>
                        Are the assignments actually required, or can I just say I did them?  In particular I am concerned about the following:<br>
                        - Assignment 1<br>
                        - Assignment 2<br>
                        - All the rest of the assignments<br>
                        <br>
                        Lectures<br>
                        Is there any point in coming to class? I looked you up on <a href=https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/840273242953005718/>"Rate My Little Pony</a>, and your ratings are pretty terrible.<br>

                        Course Website<br>
                        <br>
                        I have taken a look at the course website. It sure seems pretty weird.  Do you mind if I just ignore this part?<br>
