        Boasting from Oakland, California, Luis Scott Vargas (frequently referred to as <i>LSV</i>) is one of the most 
        influential figures in Magic: The Gathering's history
        As a hall of famer, with eight top 8 on the pro-tour circuit, LSV holds one of the most impressive careers among Magic's elite.
        With his professional debut at Pro Tour San Diego in 2004, LSV burst onto the professional scene. In the 2006 U.S. Nationals,
        LSV's team managed to take down the tournament by placing Paul Cheon in the winner's seat. This initial victory forcasted his success in what was to be the most important year
        in LSV's career; in 2007 Luis Scott Vargas took down the U.S. Nationals, and earned his first Grand Prix victory at GP San Fransisco. The blistering speed and 
        consistency of Luis Scott Vargas' results did not go unnoticed. With a total of eight Pro Tour top 8s, 15 Grand Prix top 8's, one Pro Tour victory, and five Grand Prix victories
        Luis Scott Vargas was inducted into the Magic Hall of Fame in 2013. Since then, LSV has had a variety of professional success, but has ultimately turned towards content creation in his
        partnership with Channel Fireball (a prominent Magic: The Gathering product retailer and news site). LSV has also gone on to create his own card game named Eternal, while still being active in the Magic community.
